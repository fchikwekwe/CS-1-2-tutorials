A machine learning method very loosely based on connections in the brain. A system of connected nodes that are segmented into layers.
Using very large neural networks — called deep nets — to solve complex problems.
This machine learning method uses a line of branching questions or observations about a given data set to predict a target value.
An attempt to collect and categorize sets of points into groups that are “sufficiently similar," or "close" to one another.
The process of pulling data from a website’s source code. It generally involves writing a script that will identify the information a user wants and pull it into a new file for later analysis.
The process of pulling actionable insight out of a set of data and putting it to good use.
This measures how spread out a set of values are. Mathematically, it is the average difference between individual values and the mean for the set of values.
This measures how spread out a set of values are. Mathematically, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance of a set. It's often represented by the greek symbol sigma, σ.
A data point that is considered extremely far from other points. They are generally the result of exceptional cases or errors in measurement, and should always be investigated early in a data analysis workflow.
When all of the values in a set of data have been adjusted to fall within a common range to make comparisons easier and more meaningful.
The measure of how much one set of values depends on another.
This field is highly focused on using algorithms for to gain an edge in the financial sector.
The art of communicating meaningful data visually. This can involve infographics, traditional plots, or even full data dashboards.
The discipline of using data and advanced statistics to make predictions.
It's all about the back end. Building systems to make it easy for data scientists to do their analysis.
Focused more on answering questions about the present and the past. It uses less complex statistics and generally tries to identify patterns that can improve an organization.
A discipline involving research and development of machines that are aware of their surroundings.
Another supervised machine learning problem. It focuses on how a target value changes as other values within a data set change.
A process where a computer uses an algorithm to gain understanding about a set of data, then makes predictions based on its understanding.
A supervised machine learning problem. It deals with categorizing a data point based on its similarity to other data points.
